# Music_Website
A website based on PHP, HTML, CSS, AJAX, JavaScript and MySQL where the user can listen to songs (Bengali/English) of different genres, can see lyrics, and can comment too.
Users can also get their preferred songs according to their mood and environment. 
Unfortunately, I have no record of how the site looked, it is somehow missing. But the code is saved and so here is the code.
