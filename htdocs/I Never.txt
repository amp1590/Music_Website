I'm only a woman of flesh and bone
And i wept much, we all do.
I thought i might die alone
But i had
Never, never, never,
Never, never, never,
Never, never, never,
Never, never met you.
So baby be good to me.
I got nothing to give you, you see
Except 
Everything, everything,
Everything, everything,
All the good and the bad,
'Cause i've been bad.
I've lied, cheated, stolen and been ungrateful for what i have
And i'm afraid habits rule my waking life.
I'm scared and i'm runnin'in my sleep
For you but all the oceans, and rivers and showers
Will wash it all away and make me clean
For you
'Cause i have
Never, never, never,
Never, never, never,
Never, never, never,
Never, never, met you.

So lets take a loan out, put it down on a house
In a place we've never lived.
In a place that exists in the pages of scripts
And the songs that they sing
And all of the beautiful things
That make you weep, but don't have to make you weak

'Cause i've
Never, never, never, never,
Never, never, never, never,
Never, never, never, never,
Never, never, never, never,
Never, never, never, never,
Never, never, never, never,
Never, never, never, never
Loved somebody the way
That i loved you
